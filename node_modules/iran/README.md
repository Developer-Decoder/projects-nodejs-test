On the first level of country subdivisions of Iran are the provinces.
Each province is further subdivided into counties called shahrestan (Persian: شهرستان shahrestān‎), and each shahrestan is subdivided into districts called bakhsh (Persian: بخش bakhsh‎). There are usually a few cities (Persian: شهر shahr‎) in each county.
